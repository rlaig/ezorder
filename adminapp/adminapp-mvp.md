```

### Key Principles
1. **Mobile-first design** - All interfaces must work well on mobile devices
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality works without JavaScript
3. **Real-time updates** - Order status changes reflect immediately
4. **Error handling** - Graceful degradation and clear error messages
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive design

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Manual testing on actual mobile devices
